Authors: Chris Chen, Ishaan Tibdewal

## Overview
This is a data science project analyzing Food.com recipe data, where our focus is to predict recipe ratings from review text using TF-IDF and logistic regression. It also includes exploratory data analysis, missingness assessment, and hypothesis testing on recipe nutrition and user ratings from Food.com data.

## Introduction
Food connects people, cultures, and experiences. Whether trying a new recipe, sharing a meal, or reading reviews, food is central to how we explore and share. Both of us enjoy cooking and discovering new recipes, and we often rely on online reviews (social media) to decide what to try , which sparked our interest in understanding what makes a review helpful and how review text relates to ratings.

The first dataset that we examined, `recipes`, contains 83,782 rows and 12 columns with each row corresponding to an individual recipe. The 12 columns include:

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Recipe name|
| 'id' | Text |
| | |
